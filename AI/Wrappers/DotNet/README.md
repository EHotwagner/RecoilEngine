## üìÅ Project Structure

This platform is organized into two distinct components:

### FSharp-Recoil-Wrapper/
**Pure F# engine wrapper** - Provides direct, efficient access to RecoilEngine functionality
- `src/` - F# wrapper core files (Types.fs, Interop.fs, Commands.fs, etc.)
- `native/` - Native C++ P/Invoke interface files
- Purpose: Low-level, data-oriented engine access

### FSharp-BAR-AI/
**BAR-specific AI implementation** - High-level AI logic for Beyond All Reason
- `src/` - F# BAR AI implementation files
- `examples/` - Complete working AI examples and patterns
- Purpose: Game-specific AI strategies and behaviors

This separation ensures:
- **Clean dependencies**: Wrapper has no game-specific logic
- **Reusability**: Engine wrapper can be used for other Spring games
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundary between engine interface and AI logic
- **Performance**: Each component optimized for its specific role

### Why F#-First Data-Oriented Design?

Real-time strategy games require high-performance AI that can process hundreds of units efficiently:

- **Data locality**: Arrays keep related data together for better cache performance
- **Batch processing**: Process entire arrays of units/events at once
- **Minimal allocations**: Reuse arrays and avoid GC pressure during frames
- **Functional composition**: F#'s array processing is highly optimized
- **Type safety**: Units of measure and discriminated unions prevent common bugs
- **Immutable snapshots**: Pure functions enable easy testing and debugging

## üöÄ Quick Start

### F# Data-Oriented Development (Recommended)

```fsharp
open SpringAI.Core

type DataOrientedAI() =
    // Mutable arrays for performance
    let mutable worldState = WorldSnapshot.empty
    let mutable economyTargets: EconomyTarget[] = [||]
    let eventBuffer = ResizeArray<GameEvent>()
    
    interface IAI with
        member this.OnEvent(event) =
            // Buffer events for batch processing
            eventBuffer.Add(convertToFSharpEvent event)
        
        member this.OnUpdate(frame) =
            // Batch process all events for this frame
            let frameEvents = this.ProcessEventBuffer(frame)
            
            // Update world state with efficient array operations
            worldState <- this.UpdateWorldState(worldState, frameEvents)
            
            // Run AI systems on batched data
            this.RunEconomySystem(worldState, frameEvents)
            this.RunMilitarySystem(worldState, frameEvents)
            
            eventBuffer.Clear()
    
    member private this.RunEconomySystem(world: WorldSnapshot, events: FrameEvents) =
        // Process idle builders in batch
        let idleBuilders = 
            events.UnitsIdle
            |> Array.filter (fun unitId -> this.IsBuilder(world.Units.[unitId]))
          // Assign construction tasks efficiently
        let tasks = this.PlanConstruction(world, idleBuilders)
        tasks |> Array.iter this.IssueConstructionOrder
```

**Ready to build the next generation of RTS AI with F#?** Get started with the pure data-oriented approach for maximum performance and type safety.

## Overview

This F# platform provides a pure data-oriented interface for developing AI for the RecoilEngine. It handles marshalling of data types, events, and commands through direct P/Invoke interfaces, eliminating unnecessary layers and maximizing performance.

### .NET Naming Conventions

This wrapper follows standard .NET naming conventions:
- **PascalCase** for classes, methods, properties, and file names
- **camelCase** for parameters and local variables  
- **Descriptive names** that clearly indicate purpose
- **Consistent file naming** matching contained class names

### F# Support

The wrapper is designed to be highly F#-friendly, with:
- Type-safe domain modeling using discriminated unions and records
- Active patterns for pattern matching on game entities
- Option types instead of null references
- Railway-oriented programming for error handling
- Computation expressions for command chaining
- Functional reactive programming patterns for event handling

See `FSharpConsiderations.md` for detailed F# integration guidelines.

## Architecture

The wrapper consists of two main components:

### Native Layer (`src/native/`)
- **SpringAIWrapperInterface.h/cpp**: Main interface class that manages .NET AI instances
- **SpringAIWrapperExports.cpp**: C exports required by the Spring AI interface system

### Managed Layer (`src/managed/`)
- **Interop/**: P/Invoke declarations for calling native functions
- **Events/**: .NET event classes that wrap native game events
- **AI/**: Base classes and interfaces for AI implementations
- **Types/**: Game data type definitions

## Building

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- CMake 3.10 or later
- C++ compiler (Visual Studio 2019+ on Windows, GCC/Clang on Linux)

### Build Steps

1. Ensure .NET SDK is in your PATH:
   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```

2. Configure CMake with .NET wrapper enabled:
   ```bash
   cmake -DAI_TYPES=ALL ..
   # or specifically:
   cmake -DAI_TYPES=DOTNET ..
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --target DotNet-AIWrapper
   ```

This will build both the native interop library and the managed .NET assembly.

## Creating Your Own AI

### Step 1: Inherit from BaseAI

```csharp
using SpringAI;

public class MyAI : BaseAI
{
    public override void OnInit(int skirmishAIId, bool savedGame)
    {
        base.OnInit(skirmishAIId, savedGame);
        // Your initialization code here
    }

    public override void OnUpdate(int frame)
    {
        base.OnUpdate(frame);
        // Your per-frame logic here
    }

    // Override other event methods as needed...
}
```

### Step 2: Handle Game Events

The AI receives various events from the game engine:

- `OnInit()`: Called when the AI starts
- `OnUpdate()`: Called every game frame (~30 times per second)
- `OnUnitCreated()`: When a unit starts construction
- `OnUnitDamaged()`: When a unit takes damage
- `OnUnitDestroyed()`: When a unit is destroyed
- `OnRelease()`: When the AI should shut down

### Step 3: Issue Commands

Use the `Callback` property to interact with the game:

```csharp
// Move a unit
Callback.MoveUnit(unitId, new Vector3(x, y, z));

// Attack an enemy
Callback.AttackUnit(myUnitId, enemyUnitId);

// Get game information
var friendlyUnits = Callback.GetFriendlyUnits();
float metal = Callback.GetMetal();
```

## Example AI

See `FSharp-BAR-AI/examples/` for complete F# examples that demonstrate:
- Data-oriented world state management

- Consult the Spring engine documentation for AI interface details

## License

This wrapper follows the same licensing as the RecoilEngine project (GPL v2 or later).

## How RecoilEngine/Spring Delivers Events

Based on analysis of the RecoilEngine source code, the event delivery model is:

1. **Frame-based simulation loop**: RecoilEngine runs at 30 simulation frames per second (GAME_SPEED = 30)
2. **Event callbacks are immediate**: When events occur within a simulation frame, they are delivered immediately via callbacks (not batched)
3. **OnUpdate called every frame**: The Update event is sent once per simulation frame (30 times per second)
4. **No event streaming or batching**: Events like UnitCreated, UnitDestroyed, etc. are delivered as individual callbacks when they occur

**Timing and Order**:
- Each simulation frame: `CGame::SimFrame()` is called
- During simulation: Events occur and callbacks are triggered immediately
- At frame end: `Update(frameNum)` is called on all AIs
- Events are **not** queued or batched - they arrive as soon as they happen within the frame

This means your AI will receive:
```
OnUpdate(frame=1) -> UnitCreated(id=5) -> UnitDestroyed(id=3) -> ... -> OnUpdate(frame=2) -> ...
```

The F#-first wrapper maintains this immediate callback model while providing additional safety and functional programming benefits.
